La Jolla Assembler (LJA) is a genome assembler designed for PacBio HiFi reads based on de Bruijn graph. LJA uses jumboDB algorithm to construct de Bruijn graphs for large values of k. De Bruijn graph is then used for error correction and repeat resolution. For details see https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.420448v1.

LJA is under development now but will be available in the near future.
